A React.js-based web application that utilizes NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display information of the daily picutre such as:

  Title: The title of the picture.
  Description: An explanation of the image or video.
  Date: The date the image was featured.
  HD Image: The high-definition version of the picture of the day.

I found this project to be a great learning experience, as it allowed me to combine my interest in astronomy with my programming skills. The simplicity of the project provided an excellent opportunity to practice and develop new skills. Specifically, I learned how to fetch data from an API using the useEffect React hook, and I further enhanced my abilities in both dynamic and static CSS.
